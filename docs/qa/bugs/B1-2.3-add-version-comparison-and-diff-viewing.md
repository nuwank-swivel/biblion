# Story 2.3: Add Version Comparison and Diff Viewing

## Status

**CRITICAL BUG FIX** - High Priority

## Story

As a user,
I want to compare different versions of my notes and see exactly what changed between versions,
so that I can understand the evolution of my content and make informed decisions about version restoration.

## Background

**Source**: Comprehensive Story Checklist Validation Report (Stories 1.1-2.4)  
**Issue ID**: DIFF-001  
**Severity**: High  
**Current Status**: Missing critical feature in Story 2.3 implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Version Comparison Interface**
   - Display side-by-side comparison of two selected versions
   - Show version metadata (timestamp, author, change summary)
   - Provide clear visual indicators for differences
   - Allow selection of any two versions for comparison

2. **Content Diff Visualization**
   - Highlight added content in green
   - Highlight removed content in red with strikethrough
   - Highlight modified content with background color changes
   - Show word-level and character-level differences
   - Provide line-by-line diff view option

3. **Diff Navigation and Interaction**
   - Navigate between differences with next/previous buttons
   - Jump to specific differences in long documents
   - Expand/collapse unchanged sections for focus
   - Provide diff statistics (lines added, removed, modified)

4. **Version Selection and Management**
   - Browse version history with timestamps and authors
   - Search versions by date range or author
   - Select versions for comparison from version list
   - Preview version content before comparison

5. **Export and Sharing**
   - Export diff as HTML, PDF, or text format
   - Share diff links with other users
   - Print diff comparison for offline review
   - Copy diff content to clipboard

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Source**: Story 2.3 Real-time Auto-save and Version Control  
**Integration Points**: 
- Version manager (`src/features/sync/version-manager.ts`)
- Version history UI (`src/components/ui/version-history.tsx`)
- Note editor (`src/components/layout/NoteEditor.tsx`)
- Firestore service (`src/features/data/firestore-service.ts`)

### Technical Implementation

**Diff Algorithm**:
- Use Myers' diff algorithm for optimal diff generation
- Implement word-level and character-level diff options
- Handle HTML content differences for rich text
- Optimize performance for large documents

**UI Components**:
- Side-by-side comparison layout
- Diff highlighting with CSS-in-JS
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessibility support with ARIA labels

**Data Models**:
```typescript
interface DiffResult {
  version1: VersionData;
  version2: VersionData;
  changes: DiffChange[];
  statistics: {
    linesAdded: number;
    linesRemoved: number;
    linesModified: number;
    wordsAdded: number;
    wordsRemoved: number;
  };
}

interface DiffChange {
  type: 'added' | 'removed' | 'modified' | 'unchanged';
  content: string;
  lineNumber?: number;
  wordIndex?: number;
}
```

### File Locations

- **Diff Algorithm**: `src/features/sync/diff-algorithm.ts`
- **Version Comparison UI**: `src/components/ui/VersionComparisonDialog.tsx`
- **Diff Visualization**: `src/components/ui/DiffViewer.tsx`
- **Version Selection**: `src/components/ui/VersionSelector.tsx`
- **Diff Export**: `src/features/sync/diff-export.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: `src/features/sync/version-comparison.test.ts`

### Testing

**Unit Tests**:
- Diff algorithm accuracy with various content types
- Version comparison logic and state management
- Diff statistics calculation
- Export functionality for different formats

**Component Tests**:
- Version comparison dialog rendering
- Diff visualization accuracy
- Navigation and interaction behavior
- Responsive design at different breakpoints

**Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end version comparison workflow
- Integration with version history system
- Export and sharing functionality
- Performance with large documents

**Performance Tests**:
- Diff generation performance with large documents
- UI responsiveness during comparison
- Memory usage during diff processing
- Export performance for different formats

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Version comparison works reliably with all version types
- [ ] Diff visualization accurately shows content changes
- [ ] Navigation and interaction are intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Version selection integrates seamlessly with existing UI
- [ ] Export functionality works for all supported formats
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (sub-3-second diff generation)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (95%+ for new code)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Documentation updated with diff viewing procedures

### Success Metrics

- **Diff Accuracy**: 99%+ accurate diff generation
- **Performance**: Diff generation <3 seconds for documents up to 10MB
- **User Satisfaction**: <5% of users report diff visualization issues
- **Accessibility**: 100% compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Export Success**: 99%+ successful exports in all formats

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Performance**: Diff generation could be slow for large documents
- **Accuracy**: Complex content changes might not be diffed correctly
- **User Experience**: Complex diff UI could overwhelm users

### Medium Risk
- **Integration**: Version comparison must integrate with existing systems
- **Memory Usage**: Large diffs could consume significant memory

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement progressive diff loading for large documents
- Add diff accuracy testing with various content types
- Provide simplified diff view option for complex changes
- Implement memory management for large diffs

## Dependencies

- **Story 2.3**: Real-time Auto-save and Version Control (version data)
- **Version Manager**: Integration with existing version management
- **Version History UI**: Integration with existing version history interface
- **Rich Text Editor**: Support for HTML content diffing
