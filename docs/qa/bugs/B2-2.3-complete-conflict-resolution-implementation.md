# B2-Story 2.3: Complete Conflict Resolution Implementation

## Status

**CRITICAL BUG FIX** - High Priority

## Story

As a user,
I want the system to detect and resolve conflicts when multiple users edit the same note simultaneously,
so that I never lose my work due to conflicting changes and can collaborate safely with others.

## Background

**Source**: Comprehensive Story Checklist Validation Report (Stories 1.1-2.4)  
**Issue ID**: CONFLICT-001  
**Severity**: High  
**Current Status**: Missing critical feature in Story 2.3 implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Conflict Detection**

   - Detect when multiple users are editing the same note simultaneously
   - Identify conflicting changes at the content level
   - Track revision IDs and timestamps for conflict resolution

2. **Conflict Resolution UI**

   - Display conflict resolution dialog when conflicts are detected
   - Show side-by-side comparison of conflicting versions
   - Provide clear visual indicators for added, removed, and modified content
   - Allow users to choose which version to keep or merge changes

3. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**

   - Implement "last writer wins" strategy as default
   - Provide "merge changes" option for compatible edits
   - Handle conflicts at the paragraph or sentence level
   - Preserve user intent and content structure

4. **Conflict Logging and Notification**

   - Log all conflict resolution events with timestamps
   - Notify users when conflicts occur and how they were resolved
   - Provide conflict history for audit purposes
   - Send notifications for manual conflict resolution required

5. **Integration with Version Control**
   - Create new versions when conflicts are resolved
   - Maintain version history through conflict resolution
   - Ensure version integrity after conflict resolution
   - Sync resolved conflicts across all devices

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Source**: Story 2.3 Real-time Auto-save and Version Control  
**Integration Points**:

- Auto-save service (`src/features/sync/auto-save.ts`)
- Version manager (`src/features/sync/version-manager.ts`)
- Firestore service (`src/features/data/firestore-service.ts`)
- Note editor (`src/components/layout/NoteEditor.tsx`)

### Technical Implementation

**Conflict Detection Strategy**:

- Use Firestore real-time listeners to detect simultaneous edits
- Compare revision IDs and timestamps to identify conflicts
- Implement content diffing algorithm for conflict detection
- Track user sessions and edit states

**Conflict Resolution UI**:

- Modal dialog with side-by-side content comparison
- Visual diff highlighting using CSS and JavaScript
- Action buttons for resolution choices
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

**Data Models**:

```typescript
interface ConflictData {
  id: string;
  noteId: string;
  user1Id: string;
  user2Id: string;
  user1Content: string;
  user2Content: string;
  user1Timestamp: Date;
  user2Timestamp: Date;
  resolution: "pending" | "resolved" | "merged";
  resolvedBy?: string;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
  resolutionMethod: "last_writer_wins" | "manual_merge" | "user_choice";
}
```

### File Locations

- **Conflict Detection**: `src/features/sync/conflict-detector.ts`
- **Conflict Resolution UI**: `src/components/ui/ConflictResolutionDialog.tsx`
- **Conflict Service**: `src/features/sync/conflict-service.ts`
- **Conflict Models**: `src/features/data/schemas/conflict.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: `src/features/sync/conflict-resolution.test.ts`

### Testing

**Unit Tests**:

- Conflict detection algorithm accuracy
- Content diffing and comparison logic
- Automatic resolution strategies
- Conflict logging and notification

**Component Tests**:

- Conflict resolution dialog rendering
- User interaction with resolution options
- Visual diff highlighting accuracy
- Confirmation dialog behavior

**Integration Tests**:

- End-to-end conflict detection and resolution
- Multi-user simultaneous editing scenarios
- Version history integrity after conflicts
- Cross-device conflict resolution sync

**Performance Tests**:

- Conflict detection performance with large documents
- UI responsiveness during conflict resolution
- Memory usage during conflict processing

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Conflict detection works reliably in multi-user scenarios
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI is intuitive and user-friendly
- [ ] Automatic resolution strategies handle common cases
- [ ] Manual conflict resolution provides clear options
- [ ] Conflict logging provides complete audit trail
- [ ] Integration with version control maintains data integrity
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (sub-2-second conflict detection)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (95%+ for new code)
- [ ] Documentation updated with conflict resolution procedures

### Success Metrics

- **Conflict Detection Accuracy**: 99%+ of conflicts detected
- **Resolution Time**: Average <5 seconds for automatic resolution
- **User Satisfaction**: <10% of conflicts require manual intervention
- **Data Integrity**: 100% of resolved conflicts maintain version history
- **Performance**: Conflict detection <2 seconds, resolution UI <1 second

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Data Loss**: Incorrect conflict resolution could lose user content
- **Performance**: Real-time conflict detection could impact app performance
- **User Experience**: Complex conflict resolution UI could confuse users

### Medium Risk

- **Integration Complexity**: Conflict resolution must integrate with existing systems
- **Testing Complexity**: Multi-user scenarios are difficult to test comprehensively

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive testing with multiple users
- Clear user interface with confirmation dialogs
- Automatic backup before conflict resolution
- Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Dependencies

- **Story 2.3**: Real-time Auto-save and Version Control (foundation)
- **Story 2.4**: Firestore Data Integration (real-time sync)
- **Firebase**: Real-time listeners and conflict detection
- **Version Manager**: Integration with existing version control
