## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Source**: Story 2.4 Firestore Data Integration  
**Integration Points**: 
- Firestore service (`src/features/data/firestore-service.ts`)
- Sync manager (`src/features/sync/sync-manager.ts`)
- Auto-save service (`src/features/sync/auto-save.ts`)
- Version manager (`src/features/sync/version-manager.ts`)

### Technical Implementation

**Offline Storage Strategy**:
- Use IndexedDB for local data persistence
- Implement Firebase offline persistence
- Create efficient data compression algorithms
- Handle storage quota and cleanup

**Sync Strategy**:
- Implement two-way sync with conflict resolution
- Use revision IDs for change tracking
- Create intelligent merge algorithms
- Handle network connectivity changes

**Data Models**:
```typescript
interface OfflineOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  collection: string;
  documentId: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  retryCount: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'syncing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}

interface SyncStatus {
  isOnline: boolean;
  lastSync: Date;
  pendingOperations: number;
  syncInProgress: boolean;
  errors: SyncError[];
}

interface LocalData {
  notebooks: Notebook[];
  notes: Note[];
  versions: VersionData[];
  lastSyncTimestamp: Date;
  schemaVersion: string;
}
```
