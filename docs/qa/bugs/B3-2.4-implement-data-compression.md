## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Source**: Story 2.4 Firestore Data Integration  
**Integration Points**: 
- Firestore service (`src/features/data/firestore-service.ts`)
- Version manager (`src/features/sync/version-manager.ts`)
- Offline storage (`src/features/data/offline-storage.ts`)
- Data validation (`src/features/data/validation/data-validator.ts`)

### Technical Implementation

**Compression Strategy**:
- Use gzip as primary compression algorithm
- Implement brotli for better compression ratios
- Apply delta compression for version differences
- Use selective compression based on content size

**Performance Considerations**:
- Implement compression caching for frequently accessed data
- Use Web Workers for compression operations
- Optimize memory usage during compression
- Monitor compression performance and ratios

**Data Models**:
```typescript
interface CompressionConfig {
  algorithm: 'gzip' | 'brotli' | 'none';
  threshold: number; // Minimum size to compress
  level: number; // Compression level (1-9)
  enabled: boolean;
}

interface CompressionResult {
  originalSize: number;
  compressedSize: number;
  ratio: number;
  algorithm: string;
  compressionTime: number;
  success: boolean;
}

interface CompressionStats {
  totalCompressed: number;
  totalOriginal: number;
  averageRatio: number;
  compressionCount: number;
  failureCount: number;
}
```
