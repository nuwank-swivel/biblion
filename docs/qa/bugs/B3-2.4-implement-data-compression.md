# Story 2.4: Implement Data Compression

## Status

**CRITICAL BUG FIX** - High Priority

## Story

As a user,
I want my large notes and documents to be compressed efficiently,
so that the application performs well with large content and minimizes storage costs.

## Background

**Source**: Comprehensive Story Checklist Validation Report (Stories 1.1-2.4)  
**Issue ID**: COMPRESS-001  
**Severity**: High  
**Current Status**: Missing critical feature in Story 2.4 implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Content Compression**
   - Compress note content before storing in Firestore
   - Implement efficient compression algorithms (gzip, brotli)
   - Handle different content types (text, HTML, rich text)
   - Maintain compression ratios of 60-80% for typical content

2. **Version Data Compression**
   - Compress version history data to reduce storage costs
   - Implement delta compression for version differences
   - Store only compressed versions in Firestore
   - Maintain version integrity after compression/decompression

3. **Local Storage Optimization**
   - Compress data stored in IndexedDB for offline use
   - Implement selective compression based on content size
   - Handle compression/decompression transparently
   - Optimize memory usage during compression operations

4. **Performance and Monitoring**
   - Monitor compression performance and ratios
   - Provide compression statistics and analytics
   - Implement compression caching for frequently accessed data
   - Handle compression failures gracefully

5. **User Experience**
   - Transparent compression/decompression for users
   - No impact on application performance
   - Maintain data integrity and accessibility
   - Provide compression status and statistics

6. **Scope Correction: Notebooks Dropdown Listing**
   - On opening the "Notebooks" dropdown, all available notebooks are listed immediately
   - If notebooks are loading, a non-blocking loading indicator is shown in the dropdown
   - If there are zero notebooks, show an explicit empty-state message with a clear action to create a notebook
   - No stale/empty list is shown when notebooks exist; list reflects the latest state
   - Behavior is consistent in online and offline modes (using cached/offline data when applicable)
   - Covered by component and integration tests for `NotebooksSidebar` and the three-column layout
