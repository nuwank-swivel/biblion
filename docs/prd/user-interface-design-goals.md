# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create an intuitive, distraction-free note-taking experience that feels native to web browsers while seamlessly integrating with Google Drive workflows. The interface should prioritize content creation with AI assistance readily available but not intrusive. Users should feel confident their work is automatically saved and synced, with clear visual feedback about system status.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- Progressive disclosure: Start simple with basic note-taking, reveal advanced features as users become comfortable
- Contextual AI assistance: AI suggestions appear contextually without disrupting writing flow
- Drag-and-drop organization: Intuitive notebook and page management through direct manipulation
- Real-time feedback: Immediate visual confirmation of sync status, auto-save, and AI processing
- Keyboard-first design: Power users can navigate and format without mouse interaction

## Core Screens and Views

- Authentication Screen: Clean Google SSO login with clear value proposition
- Drive Folder Selection: Simple folder picker with preview of existing notes
- Notebook Dashboard: Hierarchical view of notebooks with quick access to recent pages
- Note Editor: Full-screen writing interface with formatting toolbar and AI suggestions
- Settings Page: User preferences for sync behavior, AI settings, and display options
- Sync Status Panel: Persistent indicator showing sync status and any issues

## Accessibility

WCAG AA

## Branding

Clean, modern design with a focus on readability and minimal cognitive load. Use Google's Material Design principles where appropriate to maintain familiarity with Google Drive integration. Color scheme should be professional yet approachable, with clear visual hierarchy.

## Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive (desktop and tablet primary; mobile optimized for light edits)
