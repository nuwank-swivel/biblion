# Epic 2 Core Note-Taking Infrastructure

## Epic Goal

Implement the fundamental note-taking capabilities including rich text editor, notebook/page management, and basic data persistence through Firestore.

### Story 2.1: Notebook and Page Management System

As a user,
I want to create and organize notebooks with hierarchical pages,
so that I can structure my notes in a logical, organized manner.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Create notebook creation and deletion functionality

5. Implement infinite nested sub-pages support
6. Add notebook and page renaming capabilities
7. Create visual hierarchy display with indentation and icons
8. Implement quick page navigation with search
9. Add notebook and page metadata (creation date, last modified)
10. Store notebook and page structure in Firestore

### Story 2.2: Rich Text Editor Implementation

As a user,
I want to format my text with essential formatting options,
so that I can create well-structured and visually appealing notes.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Implement rich text editor with basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)

4. Implement offline draft protection with local storage
5. Create page recovery system for lost content
6. Add conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
7. Implement version comparison and diff viewing
8. Create manual save trigger for immediate saving
9. Add version history cleanup for old versions
10. Store version data in Firestore with proper indexing

### Story 2.4: Firestore Data Integration

As a user,
I want my notes to be automatically synchronized across devices,
so that I can access my work from anywhere.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Implement Firestore data models for notebooks, pages, and content
2. Create real-time listeners for data synchronization
3. Implement offline data persistence with Firebase offline support
4. Add data validation and error handling for Firestore operations
5. Create efficient data queries for notebook and page retrieval
6. Implement data security rules for user data protection
7. Add data migration and cleanup utilities
8. Create data backup and restore functionality
9. Implement data compression for large content
10. Add performance monitoring for data operations
