# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable Google SSO authentication for seamless user onboarding
- Provide basic note-taking functionality with rich text editing
- Implement real-time Google Drive sync for data storage
- Deliver AI-powered writing assistance (grammar, spell check, rewriting)
- Create intuitive notebook and page management system
- Ensure reliable auto-save and version control

## Background Context

The current note-taking landscape lacks seamless integration with existing cloud storage solutions, forcing users to choose between powerful note-taking features and their preferred storage ecosystem. This Phase 1 MVP addresses this core pain point by leveraging Google Drive as the data layer, eliminating backend complexity while providing essential AI-enhanced writing capabilities. Users can maintain their existing Google Drive workflows while gaining intelligent note-taking features, creating immediate value without infrastructure overhead. The focus is on establishing core functionality that validates the value proposition before expanding to advanced features.
