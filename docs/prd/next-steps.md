# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Design a minimal, distraction-free note editor and navigation for a web-only MVP that integrates Google SSO, Firestore sync, and Google Drive folder selection. Prioritize accessibility (WCAG AA), keyboard-first flows, and clear sync status indicators. Use progressive disclosure for advanced features and ensure a non-intrusive AI assistance UX.

## Architect Prompt

Draft a React + TypeScript SPA using Vite, Firebase Auth (Google), Firestore (offline enabled), and Google Drive API. Define data models for notebooks/pages, real-time listeners, autosave/versioning, and a bidirectional Drive sync process (with queue and conflict resolution). Plan Firebase Security Rules and minimal Hosting deployment. No custom backend.
