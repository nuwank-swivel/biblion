# Epic 1 Foundation & Authentication Setup

## Epic Goal

Establish project infrastructure, Firebase integration, and Google SSO authentication to enable secure user access and basic app functionality.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Firebase Configuration

As a developer,
I want to set up the React TypeScript project with Firebase configuration,
so that I have a solid foundation for building the note-taking application.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Create React TypeScript project with Vite build tool
2. Install and configure Firebase SDK with Authentication and Firestore
3. Set up Firebase project with Google Authentication provider enabled
4. Configure environment variables for Firebase API keys
5. Create basic project structure with components, services, and utilities folders
6. Implement Firebase initialization and configuration
7. Set up basic routing structure for authentication flow
8. Create development environment with hot reloading
9. Implement basic error handling and loading states
10. Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode

### Story 1.2: Google SSO Authentication

As a user,
I want to sign in with my Google account,
so that I can securely access the note-taking application.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Implement Firebase Authentication with Google provider
2. Create login page with Google sign-in button
3. Handle authentication state changes and user session management
4. Implement logout functionality
5. Create protected routes that require authentication
6. Display user profile information (name, email, avatar)
7. Handle authentication errors and display user-friendly messages
8. Implement automatic token refresh
9. Store user authentication state in Redux/Zustand
10. Create loading states for authentication process

### Story 1.3: Basic App Shell and Navigation

As a user,
I want to see a clean, functional app interface after logging in,
so that I can navigate and understand the application structure.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Create main app shell with header, sidebar, and content area
2. Implement responsive navigation sidebar
3. Add user profile section in header with logout option
4. Create placeholder pages for notebooks, settings, and help
5. Implement basic routing between main sections
6. Add loading states and error boundaries
7. Create consistent layout components (buttons, inputs, modals)
8. Implement basic theming and styling system
9. Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation
10. Ensure mobile-responsive design
