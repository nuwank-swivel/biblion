# Story 2.5: Collapsible Notebooks Column

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want to collapse the "Notebooks" column when it's not needed,
so that I can maximize the available space for the Notes and Note Detail columns and focus on my content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Add expand/collapse functionality to the "Notebooks" column header
2. Implement chevron icon (left/right arrows) to indicate collapse/expand state
3. When collapsed, the Notebooks column should completely disappear from the UI
4. When collapsed, the Notes and Note Detail columns should expand to fill the available space
5. Auto-collapse the Notebooks column on smaller screens (mobile/tablet)
6. Maintain responsive behavior across all screen sizes
7. Ensure smooth transitions when collapsing/expanding the column
8. Preserve the current notebook selection state when collapsing/expanding
9. Add keyboard shortcut support for toggling column visibility
10. Ensure accessibility compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript with Material UI components as specified in architecture [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#tech-stack]
- **Component Structure**: Follow `/src/components/layout/` organization for layout components [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#project-folder-structure]
- **Material UI Integration**: Use @mui/material and @mui/icons-material for consistent theming and components [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#library-versions]
- **Responsive Design**: Implement using Material UI Grid system with proper breakpoints [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#tech-stack]

### UI Design Specifications (from Figma)

- **Figma Design File**: https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Biblion?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=6osUQ9gD76WgcjJk-0
- **Three-Column Layout**: Notebooks (left), Notes (middle), Note Detail (right) as established in previous stories
- **Color Scheme**: White background with grey text, yellow accents for selected items and action buttons
- **Chevron Icon**: Use Material UI ChevronLeft/ChevronRight icons for consistent design language
- **Selection States**: Yellow left border with subtle grey background on selected items (maintain existing behavior)
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Follow Material UI breakpoint system (xs: 0px, sm: 600px, md: 900px, lg: 1200px, xl: 1536px)

### Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Use React useState for local column visibility state management
- **Responsive Detection**: Use Material UI useMediaQuery hook for breakpoint detection
- **Animation**: Use Material UI transitions and CSS transitions for smooth animations
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement using React useEffect with keyboard event listeners
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Component Integration

- **ThreeColumnLayout**: Update existing component to handle dynamic column visibility
- **NotebooksSidebar**: Add collapse/expand button to the header area
- **AppShell**: Ensure proper layout adjustments when column is collapsed
- **NavigationSidebar**: Maintain existing functionality when Notebooks column is hidden

### Data Models

```typescript
// Column visibility state
interface ColumnVisibilityState {
  isNotebooksColumnVisible: boolean;
  isAutoCollapsed: boolean; // true when auto-collapsed due to screen size
  lastManualToggle?: Date; // track manual user actions
}

// Responsive breakpoint configuration
interface ResponsiveConfig {
  autoCollapseBreakpoint: number; // 768px for tablet/mobile
  animationDuration: number; // 300ms for smooth transitions
  keyboardShortcut: string; // 'Ctrl+Shift+N' or 'Cmd+Shift+N'
}
```

### File Locations

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.1 established the three-column layout foundation that this story will enhance
- Story 2.2 implemented the rich text editor and layout components that need to work with the collapsible column
- Story 2.4 established Firestore data integration that should work seamlessly with the collapsible layout
- The existing Material UI theming and component structure should be maintained for consistency
- The yellow accent color and selection states from previous stories should be preserved

### Performance Considerations

- **Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for smooth 60fps animations
- **State Updates**: Minimize re-renders by using React.memo and useCallback where appropriate
- **Responsive Detection**: Debounce resize events to prevent excessive state updates
- **Memory Management**: Clean up event listeners and timeouts in useEffect cleanup functions

### Accessibility Requirements

- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Ensure AA level compliance for all new functionality
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and announcements for state changes
- **Focus Management**: Maintain logical focus order when toggling column visibility
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for all new UI elements
