## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md]

**Tech Stack:**
- React 18.2.0 with TypeScript 5.4.5
- Vite 5.2.0 as bundler/dev server
- Material UI 5.15.20 for UI components with theming
- Firebase 10.12.2 for authentication
- React Router 6.26.2 for SPA routing

**Firebase Integration:**
- Use Firebase Authentication with Google provider
- Configure GoogleAuthProvider with Drive App Data scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`
- Use `signInWithPopup` for sign-in flow
- Extract OAuth access token: `GoogleAuthProvider.credentialFromResult(result)?.accessToken`
- Store access token for Drive API calls with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Project Structure:**
[Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md]
- `/src/features/auth/` - Firebase Auth glue, provider, hooks
- `/src/components/ui/` - reusable MUI-based components
- `/src/app/` - App.tsx, main.tsx, routes.tsx, theme.ts
- `/src/lib/` - utilities and helpers

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Initialize Firebase app and Auth
2. Configure GoogleAuthProvider with Drive scopes
3. Use signInWithPopup for user authentication
4. Extract OAuth access token for Drive API usage
5. Store authentication state in memory/state management
6. Handle token refresh via Firebase session

**UI Design Requirements:**
Based on provided Figma design:
- Clean, minimalist white background
- Centered "Biblion" title in large, bold black text
- Subtitle "Your AI-powered smart note-taking app" in smaller black text
- Prominent yellow Google sign-in button with rounded corners
- Google 'G' icon on left side of button
- "Sign in with Google" text in black on button
- Proper spacing and centering throughout

### Testing
- Unit tests: auth service methods (login, logout, token refresh)
- Component tests: Login page button triggers sign-in; route guard redirects
- Integration smoke: auth state persists across reload; user profile renders
- Visual regression tests: Login page matches Figma design specifications
