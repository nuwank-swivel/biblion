## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript with Material UI components as specified in architecture [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#tech-stack]
- **Component Structure**: Follow `/src/components/ui/` and `/src/components/layout/` organization [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#project-folder-structure]
- **Material UI Integration**: Use @mui/material and @mui/icons-material for consistent theming and components
- **Responsive Design**: Implement using Material UI Grid system with proper breakpoints

### UI Design Specifications (from Figma)

- Figma reference: https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=gSPHBVvqhylH2kw5-0
- **Color Scheme**: White background with grey text, yellow accents for selected items and action buttons
- **Three-Column Layout**:
  - Left: Notebooks (navigation icons + notebook list)
  - Middle: Notes (search + view toggles + notes list)
  - Right: Note Detail (full content + formatting toolbar)
- **Selection States**: Yellow vertical bar for selected items
- **Toolbar Icons**: Bold (B), Italic (I), Underline (U), alignment, lists, quote, code, link, share, more options
- **Search Placeholder**: "Q Search notes" with magnifying glass icon
- **View Toggles**: Grid and list icons for note display modes

### Technical Implementation

- **Editor Framework**: Favor schema-driven editor (e.g., TipTap over contenteditable-only) to ensure robust marks/nodes and consistent storage
- **State Management**: Keep formatting state in the editor instance; avoid duplicating in app state
- **Data Export**: Provide deterministic content export (prefer JSON + HTML renderer) for Google Drive integration [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#storage-strategy]
- **Theming**: Ensure support for dark/light modes and high contrast accessibility using Material UI theme system
- **PWA Compatibility**: Ensure editor works offline and syncs when online [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#pwa-plan]

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Editor commands/toggles for marks and lists; keymap behavior
  - Three-column layout responsive behavior

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

#### Implementation Analysis

**Strengths:**

- ‚úÖ **Complete Rich Text Editor**: Fully functional editor with all required formatting options (bold, italic, underline, alignment, lists, quotes, code blocks)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Excellent test suite for NoteEditor component covering all major functionality
- ‚úÖ **Three-Column Layout**: Properly implemented responsive layout with NotebooksSidebar, NotesList, and NoteEditor
- ‚úÖ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full keyboard support (Ctrl+B/I/U, Ctrl+Z/Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-save Functionality**: Debounced auto-save with 1-second delay
- ‚úÖ **Material UI Integration**: Consistent theming and component usage
- ‚úÖ **State Management**: Proper React state handling and Firestore integration

**Areas for Improvement:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test Coverage Gaps**: Missing tests for NotebooksSidebar and NotesList components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Integration Testing**: No tests covering the complete three-column workflow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Accessibility**: Limited ARIA support and screen reader compatibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Debt**: Using deprecated document.execCommand API

#### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Issues:**

- Technical debt with document.execCommand (can be addressed in future iterations)
- Accessibility improvements (non-blocking for MVP)

**Medium Risk Issues:**

- Missing test coverage for layout components (could impact regression testing)
- No integration tests for user workflows (could miss interaction bugs)

#### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Add test suites for NotebooksSidebar and NotesList components
2. **Short-term**: Implement integration tests for three-column layout workflows
3. **Medium-term**: Consider migrating to modern rich text editor library
4. **Long-term**: Enhance accessibility features with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
