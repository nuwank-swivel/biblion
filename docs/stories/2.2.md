## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment
- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript with Material UI components as specified in architecture [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#tech-stack]
- **Component Structure**: Follow `/src/components/ui/` and `/src/components/layout/` organization [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#project-folder-structure]
- **Material UI Integration**: Use @mui/material and @mui/icons-material for consistent theming and components
- **Responsive Design**: Implement using Material UI Grid system with proper breakpoints

### UI Design Specifications (from Figma)
- Figma reference: https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=gSPHBVvqhylH2kw5-0
- **Color Scheme**: White background with grey text, yellow accents for selected items and action buttons
- **Three-Column Layout**: 
  - Left: Notebooks (navigation icons + notebook list)
  - Middle: Notes (search + view toggles + notes list)  
  - Right: Note Detail (full content + formatting toolbar)
- **Selection States**: Yellow vertical bar for selected items
- **Toolbar Icons**: Bold (B), Italic (I), Underline (U), alignment, lists, quote, code, link, share, more options
- **Search Placeholder**: "Q Search notes" with magnifying glass icon
- **View Toggles**: Grid and list icons for note display modes

### Technical Implementation
- **Editor Framework**: Favor schema-driven editor (e.g., TipTap over contenteditable-only) to ensure robust marks/nodes and consistent storage
- **State Management**: Keep formatting state in the editor instance; avoid duplicating in app state
- **Data Export**: Provide deterministic content export (prefer JSON + HTML renderer) for Google Drive integration [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#storage-strategy]
- **Theming**: Ensure support for dark/light modes and high contrast accessibility using Material UI theme system
- **PWA Compatibility**: Ensure editor works offline and syncs when online [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#pwa-plan]

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Editor commands/toggles for marks and lists; keymap behavior
  - Three-column layout responsive behavior
  - Search functionality and view toggle states
- **Component Tests**: 
  - Toolbar renders correctly with all Figma-specified icons
  - Buttons enable/disable based on selection; color pickers apply styles
  - Notebook and note list components with selection states
  - Pin/unpin functionality
- **Interaction Tests**: 
  - Keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo stack integrity, formatting persistence across focus changes
  - Three-column navigation and selection behavior
  - Search and filtering functionality
- **Cross-device Checks**: 
  - Mobile/desktop rendering parity and responsive toolbar behavior
  - Three-column layout adaptation for different screen sizes
  - Touch interactions for mobile devices
