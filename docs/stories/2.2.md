# Story 2.2: Rich Text Editor Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user,
I want to format my text with essential formatting options,
so that I can create well-structured and visually appealing notes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement rich text editor with basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
2. Add font size and family selection options
3. Implement text and highlight color pickers
4. Add bulleted and numbered list functionality
5. Create paragraph formatting options (alignment, spacing)
6. Implement text selection and formatting preservation
7. Add keyboard shortcuts for common formatting actions
8. Create formatting toolbar with intuitive icons
9. Implement undo/redo functionality
10. Ensure consistent formatting across different devices

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Editor foundation (AC: 1, 6, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Select editor framework (e.g., TipTap/ProseMirror/Slate) aligned with PWA goals
  - [ ] Configure schema/nodes/marks for basic formatting and lists
  - [ ] Ensure deterministic serialization for storage (HTML/JSON) and interoperability
- [ ] Formatting toolbar (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8)
  - [ ] Toolbar UI with buttons, dropdowns, and color pickers
  - [ ] Toggle bold/italic/underline/strikethrough controls
  - [ ] Font family and size selectors with sensible defaults
  - [ ] Text color and highlight color pickers with palette + custom input
  - [ ] Bulleted/numbered lists, indent/outdent
  - [ ] Paragraph alignment (left/center/right/justify) and spacing controls
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (AC: 7, 9)
  - [ ] Common shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+B/I/U, Ctrl/Cmd+Z/Y/Shift+Z)
  - [ ] Lists and headings shortcuts; ensure no conflicts with browser defaults
  - [ ] Accessible focus order and ARIA for toolbar
- [ ] State persistence + portability (AC: 6, 10)
  - [ ] Preserve formatting on selection changes, focus/blur, and across re-renders
  - [ ] Normalize cross-device rendering via CSS resets and consistent fonts
  - [ ] Define content schema versioning for forward compatibility
- [ ] Performance and resilience (AC: 9, 10)
  - [ ] Undo/redo history limits and memory management
  - [ ] Large document performance: debounced updates and minimal reflows
  - [ ] Error boundaries and safe fallbacks for unsupported features

## Dev Notes
- Favor a schema-driven editor (e.g., TipTap over contenteditable-only) to ensure robust marks/nodes and consistent storage.
- Keep formatting state in the editor instance; avoid duplicating in app state.
- Provide deterministic content export (prefer JSON + HTML renderer) for Firestore integration in later stories.
- Ensure theming support for dark/light modes and high contrast accessibility.

### Testing
- Unit tests: commands/toggles for marks and lists; keymap behavior.
- Component tests: toolbar renders; buttons enable/disable based on selection; color pickers apply styles.
- Interaction tests: keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo stack integrity, formatting persistence across focus changes.
- Cross-device checks: mobile/desktop rendering parity and responsive toolbar behavior.
