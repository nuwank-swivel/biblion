# Story 1.4 CR1 — Update app name to “Biblion 1.0” on Home screen

## Summary
Update the visible product name on the Home screen header to display “Biblion 1.0”. Ensure the copy is consistent with the design reference and persists across reloads and navigation. No functional behavior changes beyond the label update.

## Context
- Product branding update per design reference.
- Aligns with PRD Epic 1 (Foundation) and visible shell components.

## UX Reference
- Figma: [`Biblion` design](https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Biblion?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=h5YPnxtdnJEqodW9-0)

## Goals
- Replace the current app name text on the Home screen shell/header with “Biblion 1.0”.
- Keep typography, spacing, and colors consistent with the current theme.
- Ensure the label is not hard-coded in multiple places; use a single source of truth.

## Non‑Goals
- No change to PWA `manifest.webmanifest` or document `<title>` in the browser tab (tracked separately if needed).
- No navigation, auth, or data flow changes.

## Assumptions
- The Home screen header/title is rendered by the layout shell components under `src/components/layout/` and/or `src/app/App.tsx`.
- Theme and layout styles already match our design system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I open the Home route, When the app shell renders, Then I see the product label “Biblion 1.0” in the header.
2. Given I navigate between `Home`, `Settings`, and `Help`, When the layout persists, Then the header label remains “Biblion 1.0”.
3. Given I reload the app, When the initial shell loads, Then the label is still “Biblion 1.0”.
4. The label style (font, weight, size, color, spacing) follows current theme rules; no visual regressions around the header area.
5. There is a single source of truth for the app display name to avoid drift (e.g., exported constant).

## Technical Notes
- Introduce an exported constant `APP_DISPLAY_NAME = "Biblion 1.0"` in a central place (e.g., `src/app/theme.ts` or `src/app/index.ts` or a new `src/app/constants.ts`).
- Update the header component (likely `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`) to use the constant.
- If `index.html` or document title uses the name, keep as-is for this story (see Non‑Goals).

## Affected Areas (expected)
- `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` (or the component rendering the top bar title)
- New: `src/app/constants.ts` (if we introduce a central constant)

## Risks
- Multiple places may render the product name; ensure we do not miss any in the visible Home shell.
- Collisions with tests expecting the old label.

## QA Test Cases
1. Launch app → Verify header shows “Biblion 1.0”.
2. Navigate to Settings and back → Header remains “Biblion 1.0”.
3. Hard refresh → Header still “Biblion 1.0”.
4. Run UI tests for the layout (`ThreeColumnLayout.integration.test.tsx`, `App.test.tsx`) → Update assertions if they check the header text.
5. Visual pass: Confirm no spacing/overflow issues in the header at common widths (1280, 1440, 1920) and in dark/light modes if applicable.

## Definition of Done
- Acceptance criteria pass.
- Unit/integration tests updated and passing locally.
- Story file saved under `docs/stories/1.4.md`.
- Design reference link included in commit message or PR description.
