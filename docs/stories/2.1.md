# Story 2.1: Notebook and Page Management System

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want to create and organize notebooks with flat notes in a three-column interface,
so that I can structure my notes in a logical, organized manner with intuitive navigation.

## Design Reference

**Figma Design:** [Notebook and Page Management UI](https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=IQnLuDhX4ei3mhjS-0)

**Key Design Elements:**

- Three-column layout: Notebooks (left), Notes (middle), Note Detail (right)
- Clean, minimalist design with white background and grey text
- Yellow accent color for selected items and action buttons
- Navigation icons on far left: document/page, people, disk/save
- Search functionality with "Q Search notes" placeholder
- Grid/list view toggle for notes display
- Rich text editor toolbar at bottom of detail view
- Pin/unpin functionality for notebooks and notes

## Dev Notes

- Align data models and Firestore structure with Epic 2 and Firestore best practices.
- Consider batched writes and transactions for reorder operations.
- Ensure accessibility: keyboard DnD alternatives, ARIA list patterns.
- **Design Implementation Notes:**
  - Follow the three-column layout from Figma design: Notebooks (left), Notes (middle), Note Detail (right)
  - Use Material UI components with custom theming to match the clean, minimalist design
  - Implement yellow accent color (#FFD700 or similar) for selected items and action buttons
  - Navigation sidebar should be fixed width with proper icon spacing
  - Search functionality should be prominently placed in the Notes column header
  - Grid/list toggle should be positioned next to the search bar
  - Rich text editor toolbar should be fixed at the bottom of the detail view
  - Pin/unpin functionality should use appropriate icons and visual feedback

### Testing

- Unit tests: data model helpers and Firestore API wrappers.
- Component tests: notes list renders correctly, rename inline edit.
- Interaction tests: drag-and-drop reorders and persists changes.
- Integration tests: create notebook/note and see real-time updates.
- **UI/UX Testing:**
  - Test three-column layout responsiveness across different screen sizes
  - Verify navigation sidebar functionality and icon states
  - Test search functionality with various input scenarios
  - Validate grid/list view toggle behavior
  - Test pin/unpin functionality with visual feedback
  - Verify yellow accent color application for selected items
  - Test rich text editor toolbar functionality
