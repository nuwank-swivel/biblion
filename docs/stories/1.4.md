# Story 1.4: Update App Name to "Biblion 1.0" on Home Screen

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

As a user,
I want to see the application name displayed as "Biblion 1.0" on the home screen,
so that the product version is clearly visible and consistent with branding.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Home screen header/title displays "Biblion 1.0" exactly, matching typography in design
2. App title in browser tab and `index.html` is updated to "Biblion 1.0"
3. Any in-app references showing the product name on the home screen reflect "Biblion 1.0"
4. Styling, color, spacing align with Figma reference
5. Unit/UI tests cover the presence of "Biblion 1.0" in the home screen
6. No regressions to routing, auth, or layout

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update home screen header to render "Biblion 1.0" (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Confirm location of header text in `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` and/or `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`
  - [ ] Ensure typography matches theme tokens from `src/app/theme.ts`
- [ ] Update document title in `index.html` to "Biblion 1.0" (AC: 2)
- [ ] Verify any other visible home-screen name references (e.g., app bar) (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add or update tests to assert visible text "Biblion 1.0" on home screen (AC: 5)
- [ ] Run full test suite and visual check to ensure no regressions (AC: 6)

## Design Reference

- Figma: [Biblion â€“ App naming reference](https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Biblion?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=h5YPnxtdnJEqodW9-0)

## Dev Notes

- Check header/title rendering path used in Story 1.3 three-column shell; the name may be surfaced in `AppShell` or the page-level header of `HomePage`.
- Ensure single source of truth for the displayed product name to avoid duplication across components.
- Consider adding a small `APP_NAME` constant (e.g., `src/app/constants.ts`) to centralize the product label; out of scope to implement now unless needed to pass tests cleanly.

### Testing

- Update or add component test asserting the home screen contains text "Biblion 1.0".
- Verify the document title is "Biblion 1.0" after app load.
- Quick visual check to confirm style parity with Figma (font weight/size, spacing).
