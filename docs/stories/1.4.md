# Story 1.4: Home screen shows app name as “Biblion 1.0”

## Status

Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want the home screen/header to display the correct app name “Biblion 1.0”,
so that branding is consistent and I know I’m using the current version.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The primary header on the home screen displays the title “Biblion 1.0”.
2. The app name is sourced from a single configuration constant to avoid duplication.
3. The title uses existing typography and theming per Material UI, matching spacing and color rules.
4. The name appears consistently in the header bar and the browser/page title where applicable.
5. Unit tests verify the rendered text and configuration source.
6. Update screenshots/docs to reflect the new name with the Figma reference.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION_LABEL` ("Biblion", "1.0") constant(s) in a central location (e.g., `src/app/theme.ts` or `src/lib/constants.ts`) and export a combined `APP_DISPLAY_NAME` = "Biblion 1.0". (AC: 2)
  - [ ] If a constants file does not exist, create `src/lib/constants.ts` and add typed exports.
- [ ] Update `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` and/or `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` header to render `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`. (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Ensure MUI `Typography` variant and spacing match existing style tokens.
- [ ] Set document title via React effect at app boot or route change to `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`. (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add unit tests: `renders app name “Biblion 1.0” in header` and `document.title updated`. (AC: 5)
- [ ] Update docs screenshot references and note Figma link. (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

- Branding guidance: keep design clean and consistent with Material Design. [Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]
- Tech stack and project structure locations for headers/layout and theme: `src/components/layout/`, `src/app/App.tsx`, `src/app/theme.ts`, `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`. [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#project-folder-structure]
- Use existing MUI theme and typography; yellow accent remains for actions, not for the title text. [Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#tech-stack]
- Reference Figma for visual placement/spacing confirmation: https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Biblion?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=h5YPnxtdnJEqodW9-0

### Testing

- Component test for header rendering exact text `Biblion 1.0`.
- Title test: after navigating to home/app route, `document.title === 'Biblion 1.0'`.
- Snapshot or role-based query to ensure correct `Typography` variant is used.
- Verify constants are the single source of truth via import in components.
