## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see the updated app name "BibliON 1.0" in the header,
**so that** I can identify the current version of the application I'm using.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Update the app name displayed in the header from "Biblion" to "BibliON 1.0"
2. Ensure the updated name is visible in both desktop and mobile layouts
3. Maintain consistent styling and positioning of the app name
4. Verify the change is reflected across all screen sizes and responsive breakpoints
5. Ensure the app name change doesn't affect other header functionality (user profile, logout, etc.)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update app name in AppShell component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Locate the Typography component displaying "Biblion" in AppShell.tsx
  - [x] Change the text content from "Biblion" to "BibliON 1.0"
  - [x] Verify the change maintains existing styling and positioning
- [x] Test responsive behavior (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Test app name display on desktop layout
  - [x] Test app name display on mobile layout
  - [x] Verify app name is visible at all breakpoints
- [x] Verify header functionality (AC: 5)
  - [x] Test user profile menu functionality
  - [x] Test logout functionality
  - [x] Ensure no layout shifts or visual regressions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

Based on the current implementation in `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`, the app name is displayed in the header using a Material UI Typography component on line 135.

### Technical Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#tech-stack]

- React 18.2.0 with TypeScript 5.4.5
- Material UI 5.15.20 as UI component library with theming
- Responsive design with Material UI breakpoints

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/biblion-architecture-frontend-only-google-drive-storage-pwa-ready.md#project-folder-structure]

- Layout components: `src/components/layout/`
- Main app shell: `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`

### Current Implementation Details

The app name is currently displayed in the AppShell component using:

```tsx
<Typography variant="h6" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
  Biblion
</Typography>
```

This Typography component is positioned in the AppBar's Toolbar and uses Material UI's h6 variant with flexGrow: 1 to take up available space.

### Responsive Behavior

The header is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:

- Desktop: Full header with app name, user profile, and navigation
- Mobile: Condensed header with hamburger menu, app name, and user profile

### Testing

- Component tests: Verify app name displays correctly in header
- Responsive tests: Ensure app name is visible at all breakpoints
- Visual regression tests: Ensure no layout shifts or styling issues
- Integration tests: Verify header functionality remains intact
