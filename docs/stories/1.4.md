# Story 1.4: Update Home Screen App Name to "Biblion 1.0"

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

As a user,
I want the home screen to show the versioned app name "Biblion 1.0",
so that I can immediately confirm which version of the app I am using.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The visible title on the home screen displays the exact text: "Biblion 1.0".
2. The typography, size, weight, and alignment match the Figma reference.
3. No other copy is changed; only the home screen title is updated.
4. The change is scoped to UI text only; no functional behavior is altered.
5. The title remains responsive and does not wrap on standard desktop widths.
6. Automated tests cover the presence of "Biblion 1.0" on the home route.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update the home screen title to "Biblion 1.0" (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Adjust the title text in `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` (or source of the title if defined in `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`)
  - [ ] Verify alignment, spacing, and weight per Figma (AC: 2)
- [ ] Ensure no other labels are unintentionally renamed (AC: 3, 4)
- [ ] Responsive check at common breakpoints (AC: 5)
- [ ] Add/Update tests (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Component test asserts the home screen renders "Biblion 1.0"
  - [ ] Integration test confirms the title shows on `/app` default route

## Design Reference

- Figma: [Home screen title and header reference](https://www.figma.com/design/J4Dsi0o3FCgCgqrvPCAehY/Biblion?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=h5YPnxtdnJEqodW9-0)

## Dev Notes

- Scope strictly limited to the home screen header/title. Do not change the product name elsewhere (e.g., login screen, manifest, README) unless explicitly requested in future stories.
- Check whether the title originates from `HomePage.tsx` or is passed via layout components like `AppShell.tsx`. Update in a single source of truth.
- Maintain existing Material UI theme styles and spacing.

### Testing

- Unit: Title component renders exact text "Biblion 1.0" when on home screen.
- Integration: Navigating to the home route renders the title once, is visible to screen readers, and matches snapshot.
- Visual: Quick check that font size/weight and alignment match Figma at desktop width.
