# Story 1.3: Basic App Shell and Navigation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user,
I want to see a clean, functional app interface after logging in,
so that I can navigate and understand the application structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Implement responsive navigation sidebar
3. Add user profile section in header with logout option
4. Create placeholder pages for notebooks, settings, and help
5. Implement basic routing between main sections
6. Add loading states and error boundaries
7. Create consistent layout components (buttons, inputs, modals)
8. Implement basic theming and styling system
9. Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation
10. Ensure mobile-responsive design

## Dev Notes
No architecture docs present in `docs/architecture` directory to cite. Populate with standards when available.

### Testing
- Component tests: layout renders header/sidebar/content; responsive behavior at breakpoints
- Routing tests: navigation changes route and highlights active link
- Accessibility checks: tab order, focus traps for modals, ARIA roles
